# weather
This application is based on the live wheather information.<br>
You can give place name as a input parameter and it will go to the whether API and fetch the information about that place. <br>
Now the information is retrived in the JSON file. That will be parsed into the presentable format after some changes. <br>
The idea behind the project was to learn about nodeJS.
